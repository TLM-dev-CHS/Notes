- ***During WW1:***
	- Devastation, mass death/persecution, Europe being 'stabbed' and divided in all directions

- ***After WW1***:
	- Cold War, Europe was reeling from it's losses, terrible economic situation, positioned between two global powers (US + USSR).

### Thesis:

- While some nations, particularly in Eastern Europe preferred the absence of the United States and the freedom to develop their own political + socioeconomic systems, American interference had a profound impact on the redevelopment of Western European nations.
