## Project: Gravity-based, 2D Ball-Bouncing Game

This project aims to create a 2D ball-bouncing game where the user navigates a ball through various obstacles, kinda meant to kill time ngl.

## Gameplay Reference

For a visual example of what the gameplay might look like, refer to the following video.

## User Interaction

- **Menus:** Graphical User Interface (GUI) windows will be used to configure game settings before each session.
- **Settings:** While creating a settings file (e.g., INI file) is an option, it's currently considered less likely for this project.

## Outputs

- **Visuals:** The core game will be displayed through a GUI.
- **Debugging:** Textual output will be provided for logging and debugging purposes.
- **Data Storage (Optional):** If implemented, file output might be used to save game settings and past games.

## Data Structures

- **Lists:** These will be used for:
    - Storing player scores.
    - Temporarily holding data before saving it as JSON or INI files.

## Code Structure

- **Functions and Classes:** These will be utilized for:
    - Rendering game elements.
    - Managing GUI windows.
    - Simulating game physics.

## Program Flow

- **Loops:** The primary use of loops will be to control the game's runtime, which may be customizable based on whether time limits are included.

## Programming Language

- **Python:** Python 3.13.x is the intended language for this project.
